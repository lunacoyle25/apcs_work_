Brainstorming 
- Elevator that lets people in and out 
- Ice cream cone that is moving horizontally and you must stack the dropping ice cream scoops 


Task List 
- Sound 
- Drop randomly flavored icecream scoops 
    - ***make a new class for this 
- make the triangle appear after a few seconds or do like a 3, 2, 1 before it starts (a intermediate game state?)
    - can add to existing game state or do countdown gamestate 


Project Feature List 
- Need to use relative coordinates to let the game adapt to the different screen sizes and so you can change the game's size 
- Count the number of falling ice cream cones 
- 3 game states: 
    1. Welcome (SceneStart)
    2. Actual Game (ScenePlay)
    3. If/when you lose (SceneEnd)
- Keep track of score/# of scoops on cone 
- When you press the space bar, the scoop falls 
- cone speeds up over time or after a certain number of ice creams are on the cone 
- Animated splat for game over for SceneEnd
